			TERMS & CONDITIONS
		</h1></center>
		<p class="terms">
		Please read these terms and conditions of use carefully before accessing, using or obtaining any materials, information, products or services. By accessing the WAVES website, mobile or tablet application, or any other feature or other WAVES platform (collectively, "Our Website”), you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions ("Terms") and our Privacy Policy. If you do not accept all of these Terms, then you may not use Our Website. In these Terms, "we", "us", "our" and "WAVES" refers to WAVES Software Corporation, and "you" and "your" refers to you, the user of Our Website.
</p>
</br>
<p class="terms">
THESE TERMS INCLUDE AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT.
</p>
</br>
<p class="terms">

We may modify these Terms for any reason—at any time—by posting a new version on Our Website; these changes do not affect rights and obligations that arose prior to such changes. Your continued use of Our Website following the posting of modified Terms will be subject to the Terms in effect at the time of your use. Please review these Terms periodically for changes. If you object to any provision of these Terms or any subsequent modifications to these Terms or become dissatisfied with Our Website in any way, your only recourse is to immediately terminate use of Our Website.
</p>
</br>
<p class="terms">

1. We Do Not Sell Travel Products
</p>
</br>
<p class="terms">

Our Website is a travel search engine. WAVES does not provide, own or control any of the travel services and products that you can access through Our Website, such as flights, accommodations, rental cars, packages, or travel insurance (the “Travel Products”). The Travel Products are owned, controlled or made available by third parties (the “Travel Providers”) either directly (e.g., airline) or as an agent (e.g., online travel agency). The Travel Providers are responsible for the Travel Products. The Travel Provider’s terms and privacy policies apply to your booking so you must agree to and understand those terms. Furthermore, the terms of the actual travel provider (airline, hotel, tour operator, etc.) apply to your travel, so you must also agree to and understand those terms. Your interaction with any Travel Provider accessed through Our Website is at your own risk; WAVES does not bear any responsibility should anything go wrong with your booking or during your travel.
</p>
</br>
<p class="terms">

The display on Our Website of a Travel Product or Travel Provider does not—in any way—imply, suggest, or constitute a recommendation by WAVES of that Travel Product or Travel Provider, or any sponsorship or approval of WAVES by such Travel Provider, or any affiliation between such Travel Provider and WAVES.
</p>
</br>
<p class="terms">

WAVES hosts content, including prices, made available by or obtained from Travel Providers. WAVES is in no way responsible for the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of such content. Since WAVES has no control over the Travel Products and does not verify the content uploaded by the Travel Providers, it is not possible for us to guarantee the prices displayed on Our Website. Prices change constantly and additional charges (e.g., payment fees, services charges, checked-in luggage fees, local taxes and fees) may apply, so you should always check whether the price asked for a booking is the one you expected. More details here. Some Travel Products may also be sold in another currency than the one preset or chosen by you for the display of the search results. Our currency conversion is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as accurate or real-time; actual rates may vary, and your payment provider (e.g., your credit card company) may charge conversion fees and apply another date’s currency rate.
</p>
</br>
<p class="terms">

2. Booking through WAVES
</p>
</br>
<p class="terms">
	
If you make a booking through Our Website for Travel Products, that booking is made with the Travel Provider named on the booking page and Our Website only acts as a user interface. Accordingly, WAVES has no responsibility for the booking or the Travel Product because WAVES has no involvement in creating the description of the Travel Product, in defining the price and any fees, or in providing the Travel Products that you book. If you have any issues or disputes with your booking and/or the Travel Product, you agree to address and resolve these with the Travel Provider and not with us.
</p>
</br>
<p class="terms">


3. Intellectual Property

 5. Warranty Disclaimer
</p>
</br>

<p class="terms">
Our Website, all content and services provided on Our Website and all itineraries that you obtain through Trips are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. Our content is largely generated in an automated fashion; errors can and do happen. We usually have many search results, but we are not comprehensive and do not display all available providers and offers. Accordingly, we do not always display the lowest available price. WAVES expressly disclaims—to the fullest extent permissible—all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and security and accuracy, as well as all warranties arising by usage of trade, course of dealing, or course of performance.

<p class="terms">
6. Our Liability Is Limited
</p>
</br>

<p class="terms">
We (together with our officers, directors, employees, representatives, shareholders, affiliates, and providers), to the extent permitted by law, hereby expressly exclude any responsibility and liability for (a) any loss or damages to, or viruses that may infect, your computer equipment or other property as the result of your access to Our Website, your downloading of any content from Our Website or your use of Trips or (b) any injury; death; loss; claim; act of god; accident; delay; or any direct, special, exemplary, punitive, indirect, incidental or consequential damages of any kind (including—without limitation—lost profits or lost savings), whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, that arise out of or is in any way connected with: (i) any use of Our Website, Trips or our content; (ii) any failure or delay (including—without limitation—the use of or inability to use any component of this Website for reservations or booking); or (iii) the performance or nonperformance by us or any Travel Provider, even if we have been advised of the possibility of damages to such parties or any other party.

8. Arbitration and Waiver
</p>
</br>

<p class="terms">
